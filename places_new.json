We got however some good advice what to buy for our tasting at home....\nPavel Hozak — Google review\nIt is nice to find all the small winery's wines in one place. I was hesitant to give 4 starts because people mentioned about wine tasting but they told us that they do not have that ... I purchased their red and fruit wine and will add that review after I have taste them. They should have different labels for their wine bottles. Now, I do not know which one is red and which one is fruit wine since both bottles have red wine label on them.\nSee more\nelif bengu — Google review\nWine tasting after hiking the valley and the rruins is a great reward.

Today this church from 1850 serves as a small museum and occasionally as a concert hall. The museum tells about the Greek history of the village and its inhabitants. Once a year the Greek Orthodox Patriarch comes from Istanbul to celebrate a mass.
